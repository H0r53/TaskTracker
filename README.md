## About

The TaskTracker website will allow users to create development teams and projects under each team. Tasks that are associated with each project will be assigned to members of that projectâ€™s team. Users can update their assigned tasks with comments and mark tasks as complete. Tasks can be further validated by a member of a Quality Assurance team. Metrics from each project are aggregated to provide helpful graphs and statistics to project administrators.
